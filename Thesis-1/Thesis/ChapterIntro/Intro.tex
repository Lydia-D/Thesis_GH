epoch synchrosation followed by two fold optimisation process\\
need instantanous relative positioning with minimal calibration or setup of external hardware

Instantaneous Relative displacement/position between GNSS receivers.\\
Simulation case studies are presented to validate the mathematical models.\\

The algorithm presented is designed to replace current methods.

With a local reference point with a well known global location, the relative position of the other receivers
